# Week 1
## Brief Summary
During week 1 I instantly start coding the base of the web app. Why? Because most of the web apps have a similar startup boilerplate. You can think of the folder structure, basic routing for express, most of these stuff is the same so i just started doing that. After that i did a little research of other dating websites about how they did they styling and some ui elements.

### Folder structure
I have chosen to host my whole `App` in a dedicated directory. The reason why i did this, is because i have some other files i need to run to create dummy-data and for some test runs. In my mind it is logical because those mentioned files are not a part of the app itself. The rest of the structure is pretty basic.
